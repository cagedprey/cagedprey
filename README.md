Salutations, Greetings, Hello, Hey! 
  </p>

  <p align="center">
I was formerly known as Arch, I now go by a diff name! There was rumors spread that I was a proshipper, they were not true, and were taken from something that I didn't even know what is was... however how I lied low for a bit i'm open again! My new main is @Azresash, I will NOT accept and you will be called out. ^_^ I would like to thank all my friends for being with me, Lemon I apologize for randomly unfriending you, others too. I have grown back stronger and refuse to make the same mistakes (choices, friends, etc..)! Please ask to be my friend again through whispers if you want to.
